# NotesApp-MAUI
This app was made thanks to [Microsoft's Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/?view=net-maui-7.0).  
Enjoy this **cross-platform** app, which allows you to **take notes**, **store them** in a collection of notes, and even have a **persistent storage** of them!  

I may update it in the future (and had more of my personal touch, mostly in the UI), but I learned a lot thanks to this first approach of .NET MAUI *(XAML and C#)*.
